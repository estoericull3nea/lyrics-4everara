HTML structures content, CSS styles presentation, and JavaScript adds interactivity. They form the foundation for modern web development, creating rich, responsive, and interactive web experiences across browsers.</h2>

<h4>What is HTML, CSS, JS?</h4>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It provides a set of tags that define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more. HTML is a static language, meaning it primarily focuses on the presentation and organization of content rather than interactivity.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and visual appearance of HTML elements. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of a web page. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), you can easily apply consistent styles to multiple web pages and achieve a cohesive design.</p>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that enables interactivity and behavior on web pages. It runs on the client-side, meaning it executes in the user's web browser. JavaScript allows you to add various interactive elements, such as form validations, dynamic content updates, animations, and more. With JavaScript, you can respond to user actions, manipulate HTML elements, and communicate with servers to fetch or send data asynchronously.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of modern web development. HTML defines the structure, CSS handles the presentation, and JavaScript brings interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. They are often used in conjunction with each other to create rich, responsive, and interactive web experiences.</p>
